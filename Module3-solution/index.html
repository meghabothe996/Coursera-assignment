                        The term "chai" originated from the Hindi word "chai", which was derived from the Chinese word
                        for tea, cha (see: Etymology of tea). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as
                        masala chai,[4] or simply chai,[5] even though the term refers to tea in general in the original
                        language. Numerous coffee houses use the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to
                        indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a caffè latte, but mixed
                        with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso. By 1994, the term had gained currency on the
                        U.S. coffeehouse scene. Masala chai (/tʃaɪ/; lit. 'mixed-spice tea') is a tea beverage made by
                        boiling black tea in milk and water with a mixture of aromatic herbs and spices.[2] Originating
                        in India, [3] the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee
                        and tea houses. Although traditionally prepared as a decoction of green cardamom pods, cinnamon
                        sticks, ground cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn together with black tea leaves,
                        retail versions include tea bags for infusion, instant powdered mixtures, and concentrates. The tea is usually a strong black tea 
                        base tea is usually a strong black tea such as Assam, so the spices and sweeteners do not
                        overpower it. Usually, a specific type of Assam is used called mamri. Mamri tea has been cured
                        in a special way that creates granules as opposed to "leaf" tea. It is inexpensive and the tea
                        most often used in India. However, a wide variety of teas is used to make chai. Most chai in
                        India is brewed with strong black tea, but Kashmiri chai is brewed with gunpowder tea. The
                        recipe or preparation method for masala chai is not fixed, and many families have their own
                        versions of the tea. Most masala chai contains caffeine, typically one-third that of coffee (if
                        made with a black tea base). The tea leaves steep in the hot water long enough to extract
                        intense flavour, ideally without releasing the bitter tannins. Because of the large range of
                        possible variations, masala chai can be considered a class of tea rather than a specific kind.
                        However, masala chai has five basic components which are almost always present: water, tea
                        leaves, milk, sugar, a mixture of cardamom and black pepper, and ginger. The western adaption of
                        chai, or chai latte, has a lighter and sweeter taste than the Indian version of a more herbal
                        and spicier milk beverage. As an alternative to the hot tea format, several types of cold "chai"
                        beverages have become popular in the United States. These range in complexity from a simple
                        spiced iced tea without milk to a slush of spiced tea, ice, and milk (or nondairy creamer) mixed
                        in a blender and topped with whipped cream.[22] It is essentially different from the original
                        version of a hot beverage.
                        Liquid "chai concentrates" have become very popular.
                        Most American coffeehouse chains use commercial liquid concentrates instead of brewing their own
                        chai from scratch. Dry powdered or granular mixes similar to instant coffee are also
                        commercially available. Chatillon Chai is a tea concentrate blend originating from the Basque
                        region in the 18th century. <br>

                        Coffee is a beverage that puts one to sleep when not drank. 
                        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
                        Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
                        unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a
                        consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into a powder and typically steeped in hot
                        water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter,
                        slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,primarily due to its caffeine content.[3]
                        It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and can be prepared and presented in a
                        variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It
                        is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk
                        or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another
                        sweet dessert like doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is
                        known as a coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis). Clinical
                        research indicates that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial as a
                        stimulant in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption reduces
                        the risk of some diseases, although some of the long-term studies are of questionable
                        credibility.[5] The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking as the modern beverage appears
                        in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were
                        first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[2] The
                        Yemenis procured he coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries,
                        and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East
                        and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are
                        C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the
                        equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of
                        2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6] Coffee
                        is a major export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[7]
                        It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted
                        coffee is the most traded agricultural commodity, and the coffee trade is the most traded
                        commodity second only to petroleum.[8] Despite the sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars,
                        those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living in poverty.[9] Critics also
                        point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for
                        coffee-growing and water use. Way too much coffee. The environmental costs and wage disparity of farmers is causing
                        the market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand. <br>

                        It’s a faceoff between two of the most consumed beverages in the world, and the debate of the
                        winner is as long as the drinks themselves! Both of these are wildly popular around the world
                        and are taken with breakfast meals, although after preparation in different ways to suit
                        preferred tastes. Some people prefer tea with milk, while others like it with a hint of honey
                        and lemon. Similarly, some need dark espresso shots to get themselves going for long periods,
                        while some prefer their coffee sweet with a sugary taste. Such is the love and passion for these
                        drinks, that no one would trade them for anything else in the world. To take an example, tea in
                        India is more than a necessity: Different flavors are brewed in as per the regional taste, and
                        people prefer a number of drinks over the course of the day. In India, chai is not just a
                        beverage. It’s an emotion! While the tons of varieties in chai and coffee have their own sets of
                        benefits to offer, everyone resorts to having their favorite cup at the end of the day. However,
                        the choice may just vary as per the need and the situation. For instance, a hectic morning
                        routine and coffee is the immediate choice. Starting with a widely known fact, chai the most
                        popular beverage in the world after water. However, consumption and favoritism do vary for
                        different regions around the world, owing to the taste and regional preferences. It is obvious
                        from the statistics above that most countries in the east prefer tea, while those in the west
                        are fans of coffee. This is chiefly due to the social and cultural differences making up for the
                        preferences of people in these places. A strong cup of coffee can get you going for a long day
                        ahead, whilst a soothing cup of tea can help you relax after a strenuous day! In the end, it
                        comes down to what the person prefers. There have been tons of speculations and research wherein
                        the studies seemed to swing between dire warnings and promising benefits about what these
                        beverages do and don’t do. However, most of the recent findings have been in support of both.
                        Research shows that tea drinkers have lower risks of several cancers; it is chiefly due to the
                        presence of essential compounds like antioxidants and polyphenols, known to lower cholesterol
                        and blood pressure. After a long period, the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer
                        struck off coffee from its list of suspected carcinogens, and recent studies show that the drink
                        might even help prevent Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. In the end, it is said to be quite
                        difficult to separate individual ingredients, their roles in the diet, and their effect on
                        different body systems. Health benefits and side effects might be of consideration, but these do
                        not help overcome the long-lasting love and admiration for these drinks. A balanced individual
                        might always look forward to having different preferences given the situations. Whatever it is,
                        both these have had a special place in the hearts of millions out there and will continue to do
                        so. However, we Indians have it in our blood to favor chai over anything else: Anytime, any
                        place. <br>

        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p>
            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
            elements,
            which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or
            act a
            certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize
            words,
            can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
            HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about the element.

        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>
            Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
            language.
            CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that
            styles
            web
            content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I
            make
            text
            red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the(webpage) layout? How do I decorate my
            webpage
            with background images and colors?

        <h4>Javascript</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to
            a
            website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and
            the
            Mozilla Corporation). JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be
            able to
            create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript
            itself
            is relatively compact, yet very flexible.
